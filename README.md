The sales performance of a retail store was analyzed using available data to shed more light on top selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.
## Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a retail store over the past 20 months. By exploring various aspects of the sales data, I tried to identify trends, make recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the store's performance.

### Data Sources
The primary data set used for this analysis is the "LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx" , which contains detailed information about each sale made by the store.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data cleaning phase, I carried out the underlisted tasks:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Removing duplicate values
3. Handling missing values and narrow columns
4. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This involved exploring the sales data to answer questions such as:
